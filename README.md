# Pink Floyd Responsive Website Project

### What does it do and what need does it fulfill?

This Milestone project uses skills learned from first three modules of the Full Stack 
Developer Course, HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development, to build a mobile-first 
fully responsive website for a 1960's rock band.
It fulfils the need for fans and potential fans to listen to Pink Floyd's music, watch their 
videos and images. Website includes tour dates and band member info with wikipedia links, 
link to social networks, YouTube channels and a link to Fan Club.

This website was made for all the fans and potential fans who want to enjoy music, videos and images 
of their favourite rock band.

### Functionality of project



Website has been created using Bootstrap Framework grid. Designed for mobile devices as a single page with 
simple navigation bar. Navigation bar is collapsed into a hamburger button for mobile devices, so it does
not take much space on the screen. On the bigger screen navigation bar is expanded so all links
are visible.

</p>


Links are connected to titles of the content sections with a return to top arrow icon next to  
title. Website contains multiple working links to wikipedia, social media and two Pink Floyd YouTube
channels, all set to open in new browser tab. Ticket button is not connected to outside link. Form and modal are
also included for contact and Fan Club. Both form and modal hold data validation and all fields residing within are 
set to required ensuring information submitted is of the correct format but they don't alert anyone from the Webteam
that a form has being filled nor do they fill a database. As is customary, form notify the user that their personal 
information will not be shared with anyone, ensuring a sense of General Data Protection Regulations.

### Technologies used

  * HTML5#
  * CSS3
  * Bootstrap
  * Ubuntu
  * Bash
  * Cloud 9 IDE
  * Git

  * Chrome developer tools
  * Javascript and JQuery as a part of Bootstrap for modals

### Deployement

Website was created in Cloud 9 IDE. Through Cloud 9 a local GITHUB repository was used  for version 
control and then uploaded to Git using Ubuntu / Bash script. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was 
made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: 

<b>https://swraab.github.io/milestone_project_1/</b>

### Testing 

Throughout the work on the project, website was regulary tested locally and on GITHUB in Chrome developer tools to
ensure every element is responsive. Starting from the mobile-first side every element was tested to 
ensure it functions as expected. Website was tested in Chrome, Opera, Mozilla and Brave browsers.
Using the device selector through the dev tools, each device was selected to achieve the responsivness
needed. All errors were fixed before new content was introduced on the page. On early stages problem
were images. That problem was resolved with Bootstrap responsive images. All links were tested to 
ensure they all open in new browser tab. Modal and form have been tested to ensure all input fields require 
specific format (text or email adress) and display warning if wrong format was entered.
Last tests were made in HTML and CSS validators and all errors were corrected.
